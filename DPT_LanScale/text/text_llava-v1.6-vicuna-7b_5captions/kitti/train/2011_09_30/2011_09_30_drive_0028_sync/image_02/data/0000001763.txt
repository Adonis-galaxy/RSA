A sunny day in a residential neighborhood with narrow streets and houses.
A narrow street between two houses.
A quiet residential street, lined with houses and trees, where the sun casts a warm glow on the brick pavement.
A narrow, tree-lined street between two-story houses, with a few cars parked along the sides and a person walking on the right side.
A narrow, tree-lined street between two-story houses, with a clear sky overhead.
