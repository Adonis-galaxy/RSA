A winding road through a lush green forest.
A tree-lined road.
A solitary road stretches through a lush, tree-lined forest, with a single car in motion, creating a sense of tranquility and the beauty of nature.
A long, winding road with a few trees on either side, leading to a distant horizon.
A winding, tree-lined road with a clear sky overhead.
