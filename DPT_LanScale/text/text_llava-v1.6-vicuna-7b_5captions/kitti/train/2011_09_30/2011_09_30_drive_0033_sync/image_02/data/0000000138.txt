A sunlit, tree-lined road curves gently to the right, with a sidewalk on the left.
A tree-lined road.
A serene, tree-lined road that curves gently to the right, inviting a journey through the tranquil forest.
A long, narrow, tree-lined road with a curved bend, leading to a distant horizon.
A winding, tree-lined road with a clear sky overhead.
