A tree-lined road.
A serene, tree-lined road with a lone pedestrian, captured in a single, wide-angle shot.
A person stands on a sidewalk next to a street lined with trees, under a clear sky.
A winding road through a lush green forest, with a clear sky overhead and a person standing on the sidewalk.
