A serene country road surrounded by lush greenery.
A tree-lined road.
A solitary road stretches through a lush, tree-lined forest, with a single pedestrian walking on the sidewalk, under the watchful gaze of a distant street lamp.
A long, tree-lined road with a pedestrian sidewalk on the right side, leading towards a clearing in the distance.
A tree-lined road curves gently to the right, with a pedestrian path on the left, and a lone figure walks along the road.
